# jargon-terms

The idea is to provide list of words that could release under MIT license.

So these words could be reused in other projects like:

- [jargonLint](https://github.com/jargonLint/jargonLint)
- [cspell-dicts](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell-dicts/)
- [textlint-rule-terminology](https://github.com/sapegin/textlint-rule-terminology)
- [harper](https://github.com/Automattic/harper/)

## Project structure

- [jargon-extractor.sh](jargon-extractor.sh) - the tool itself
- [known.txt](known.txt) - the list of words that were identified manually as valid words
- [ignore.txt](ignore.txt) - the list of words that could be considered as stop words or noise
